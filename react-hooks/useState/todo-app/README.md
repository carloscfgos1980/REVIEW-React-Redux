## in App.js

1. All this shit of contructor, super, this state is decapocrated, instead is the useState like above.
2. The HandleChange function is way more simplier with hooks. Check example.
3. Render is not longer needed. Just return like above.

## TodoItems.js

The mapping is doing here isntead of doing in App.js like it was done with the original class-based todo-app. It could be also done in the App.js but this way is simplier.
