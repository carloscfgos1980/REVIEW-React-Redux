II. Redux_API-Todo-chrisblakely
III. Redux_API-part I(element)-ShoppingCart-nikhil
IV. Redux_API-part II(Thunk)-ShoppingCart-nikhil

I. The blog-app made by The Net Ninja is done in class-bassed components. This is a outdated code so I only have as a reference if I come across to an app written in this code. It is very eyedunfriendly way to coding


I. chrisblakely todo-app tutorial is divided in two parts(without API & with API). He uses
createAsyncThunk

This a way to create extrareducers and the reducers and not longer need. It seems a bit weird but it works. It is not ncessary to dive to hard on this coz it seems this will change soon.

III. Nikhil shoppingCart-app tutorial 4 parts:

1. Based (in Redux-based folder)
2. No Api (Redux-NoAPI folder)
3. API making the call from a component.
4. API making the call from the store. With this one I have a bug that I diodnt resove but it is not very important. Explanation in README.md
