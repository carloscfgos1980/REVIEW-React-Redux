## Note_Tutorials-Redux

I created this 3 folders:

1. Based.
2. No API.
3. API

* In the first file (Based) I included different methods for Redux. Most of them quite outdated except for Nikhil.

** In NoAPI file I included 
1. shoppingCart-app of Nikhil (fase II).
2. todo-app of chrisblakely (fase I).

*** In the API file I included:

1. The Net Ninja (complete).
2. shoppingCart-app of Nikhil (fase III - final).
3. todo-app of chrisblakely (fase II - final).

N: The Net Ninja app is from 2018. He uses class-bassed components. It is very complicated and uneyedfriendly. Just have it there in case that we bump into an app with such codes.
