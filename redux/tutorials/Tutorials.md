1. The Net Ninja

N: It is from 2018. He uses class-bassed components. It is very complicated and uneyedfriendly. Just have it there in case that we bump into an app with such codes.

2. Winc Academy part I and II

N: Also a bit a bit old (2019). It contains 2 states:
1. Amount (in order to count, sum and reduce)
2. isLogged (to show certain documentation) 


3. Redux Tutorial - Learn Redux from Scratch

N: It is quite ok, update talking (2020) but is uncomplete. We need to pay to get the whole tutorial. It has important tips that could be useful like import all the function like this:
import * as actions from './actionTypes'

It also shows well how to use if else or switch method. How to add items to the array in the state and how to delete them. Also how to change the state of a single onject in the array (Ex: isCompleted: true)
