	*** Based ***
N: This are based tutorial for Redux.


1. Winc Academy part I and I

N: very based of Redux made in a single component. It is not very useful, especially after seen other tutorials. This was adviced by Winc Academy.... piece of shit!

2. Winc Academy part II

N: Also a bit a bit old (2019). It contains 2 states:
1. Amount (in order to count, sum and reduce)
2. isLogged (to show certain documentation) 


3. Redux-Mosh_Hamedani

N: It is quite ok, update talking (2020) but is uncomplete. We need to pay to get the whole tutorial. It has important tips that could be useful like import all the function like this:
import * as actions from './actionTypes'

It also shows well how to use if else or switch method. How to add items to the array in the state and how to delete them. Also how to change the state of a single onject in the array (Ex: isCompleted: true)


4. anthony-sistilli-redux-toolkit

N: This is way more updated(2021) and simplier way to write codes in redux su fuck the 3 other methods. I will stick to this one. Details in the README.md

5. learning-react-nikhil_1
N: Fuck anthony-sistilli-redux-toolkit! It is a way more simplier! and modern (2022).
I dont need if else or switch method with ConfigureStore.
