## Class=based components is an outdated way of modifuying state.
N: I would never us this method but I could run into it while checking other people codes so here there are some examples and explanations.

LEvel of complexity:
1. TimeOfDay-app
2. Log_in-out
3. Conditional renders (3 examples).
4. todo-app (7 lessons)
5. meme-generator.
6. Winc-shoppingCart
This last one is the most complex one. It is a fusion of class-based components and hooks. It is the solution offered by Winc Academy. A really fucked up app because it mix both methods and this motherfucker change the name of the function everytime he passed as a props to a child component which makes it very difficult to fig out what he actually did.
